### What is the Two Pointers Pattern?
    - The Two Pointers technique involves using two indices (pointers) to iterate over a data structure
    (usually an array or a string) to solve problems efficiently by avoiding nested loops.

### When to Use Two Pointers?
    
    - When you need to find pairs, triplets, or subarrays meeting certain conditions.
    
    - When the data is sorted or can be sorted.
    
    - When you want to optimize brute force solutions that use nested loops (O(n2)) to linear or
      near-linear time (O(n)).

### How It Works?
    You maintain two pointers that move through the data structure according to certain rules:

    - One pointer starts at the beginning, the other at the end (common in problems like
      finding pairs with a sum).
        
    - Or, both pointers start at the beginning, with one moving faster than the other (useful for
      sliding window problems).
          
    - Move pointers towards each other or forward depending on the problem condition.

### Typical Approach:
    
    1. Initialize two pointers, left and right.

    2. Check condition based on the current pointers.

    3. Move pointers accordingly:
        - If condition not met, move left or right pointer to try to satisfy the condition.
        - If condition met, record the answer or move pointers to find more solutions.
        
    4. Repeat until pointers cross or reach the end.
